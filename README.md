Welcome to the Poker Tracking and Analysis tool!

This project aims to use computer vision and image recognition to track live poker games, using OpenCV. It also includes a login system that tracks players' hand history and bankrolls using SQL databases.

In addition, the project utilizes Python logic and GTO (game theory optimal) poker strategies to compute the expected value of various plays and attempt to rank players' skill levels.

Finally, the project employs neural networks to try and predict and beat the playstyle of each player.

This project is still under development, but we hope that it will be a valuable resource for poker players looking to improve their game and track their progress. Thank you for checking it out!

Here is some more information about the specific features and capabilities of this Poker Tracking and Analysis tool:

Live Tracking: Using OpenCV and image recognition, the tool is able to track live poker games in real-time. This means that it can automatically detect and record information about the cards being played, the players involved, and the current game state.

Login System: Players can create accounts and login to the tool in order to track their hand history and bankroll over time. This information is stored in SQL databases, allowing players to easily access and analyze their past performance.

GTO Analysis: The tool uses Python logic and GTO poker strategies to compute the expected value of various plays and help players make more informed decisions at the table. It can also be used to rank players' skill levels based on their play style.

Neural Network Predictions: The tool employs neural networks to try and predict and beat the playstyle of each player. This can be used to identify patterns in a player's behavior and make more accurate predictions about their actions.

Overall, this Poker Tracking and Analysis tool is designed to be a comprehensive resource for poker players looking to improve their game and track their progress over time. We hope that it will be a valuable asset for anyone looking to up their poker skills.
